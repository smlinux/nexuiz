<H1>Templates</H1>
<P>The Nexuiz demo recorder offers you
templates that you can use to create new jobs (which are based on a
template) more quickly and efficiently. Imagine these &quot;templates&quot;
didn't exist ... you would always have to specify the complete path
to the engine, the video file, the demo file, and the final video
file &ndash; each single time when creating a job, from scratch. This
would take a long time and would be inefficient.</P>
<P>Instead you are encouraged to create
templates. Templates can be created either from scratch (click on the
<B>+ Create</B> button next to the template table) or from an
existing job (select the job, then click on the button <B>Create from
job</B>).</P>
<P>The latter will just add a new entry
in the templates table, without prompting you for any further
information. The template's name and summary will be &quot;Generated
from job&quot;, and you can change this by double-clicking this
generated template, renaming it and giving it a meaningful summary,
then click save. You will notice that all other values have been
taken from the job and don't need to be filled out by you anymore.</P>
<P>Here you can see the template dialog
when creating a new template:</P>
<P><img src="images/create_template.gif" /></P>
<P>The dialog looks very much alike the
&quot;create job&quot; dialog presented to you in the <a href="basic_tutorial.html#jobs_create">Basic
tutorial</a>. There are a few differences, however:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The dialog shows you a <B>template
	name</B> and <B>description</B></P>
	<LI><P>Instead of specifying a <B>demo
	file</B> you are now specifying a <B>demo directory</B></P>
	<LI><P>Instead of specifying a <B>video
	destination file</B>, you now just specify the <B>directory</B></P>
	<LI><P>You
	don't specify a <B>start time</B> or <B>end time</B> for templates,
	because these 2 input parameters are specific for each job and don't
	make sense to be saved for a template</P>
</UL>
<P>Once you have a template you can
create new jobs easily by selecting a template in the templates table
and then click on the <B>Create from template</B> button in the jobs
panel.
</P>
<H2>What could templates also be good
for?</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Using different configs for
	recording (you can set a config to be used either in the &ldquo;engine
	parameters&rdquo; field, e.g. <B>+exec myconfig.cfg</B>, or you
	could put the <B>exec myconfig.cfg</B> into the &ldquo;exec before&rdquo;
	field.</P>
	<LI><P>Recording with different Nexuiz
	engines to compare the visual quality</P>
	<LI><P>Inspire me &hellip; what do you
	use templates for? Post it to the forum!</P>
