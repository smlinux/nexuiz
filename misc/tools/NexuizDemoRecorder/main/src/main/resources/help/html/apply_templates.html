<H1>Applying templates</H1>
<P>Since version 0.3 you are able to
selectively apply settings from a template of your choice to any job
you like. One reason might be that you want jobs that have already
been recorded to be recorded using different config settings (e.g.
other quality settings, resolution, etc.). If you wanted to do this
for many jobs at once, it would be very tedious to edit each job
manually, setting up changes.</P>
<P>You can apply properties of templates
very easily:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Select the template you want to
	use</P>
	<LI><P>Select the job(s) whose
	properties you want to be affected by the template</P>
	<LI><P>Right-click inside the jobs
	table and select &ldquo;Apply template&rdquo;</P>
	<LI><P>A new dialog will open where you
	will be able to select which one of the settings should be copied
	from the template to the job. Please, be aware that old settings of
	the job will be overwritten!</P>
	<LI><P>Usually the settings will be
	copied 1:1 from the template to the job. <B>There are 2 exceptions,
	though</B>:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P><B>Demo directory:</B> Here
		copying the value from the template to the job would not make
		sense, because in a template you actually specified a <B>directory</B>,
		<U>not</U> a <B>file</B>. However, a job needs to point at a <B>file</B>.
		What will happen shall be demonstrated by the following example:
		Let's say that the job's path to the demo file (before applying the
		template) has been <B>C:\Nexuiz\data\demos\mydemo.dem</B>
		and the path setup in the template has been pointing to the
		directory<B> C:\Games\Nexuiz2.5.2\data\demos</B>.
		The new demo file path, after the &ldquo;apply&rdquo; process is
		done, would be <B>C:\Games\Nexuiz2.5.2\data\demos\mydemo.dem</B>;
		this means that from the <B>job's</B>
		demo path the program will just take the name of the demo by itself
		(mydemo.dem), and put the path from the <B>template</B>
		in front of it</P>
		<LI><P><b>Video
		destination:</b> Here the same thing happens like for the Demo
		directory. The new video destination will be &lt;Directory set up
		in the template&gt; + &lt;just the filename of the setting of the
		job&gt;</P>
	</UL>
</UL>
<P>Another example of how this feature could be useful is this one: Suppose some
movie maker was to create a community movie with frags from different
people, or a movie maker was to continue or finish a movie from
someone else. If one person creates a queue of jobs (which naturally
includes the demo's names, start second and end second) and then
decides not to record the frags herself but send it to some other
movie maker, all that needs to be done is to save the job queue and
send it to the other movie maker, together with the demos. The other
movie maker can then copy the demos into his own demo directory and
import the job queue. Of course the problem would then be that all
these imported jobs could not really be executed right away, because
all these paths might be incorrect, I mean, would simply not exist or
match to the system of the movie maker who wants to record the jobs
(e.g. path to Nexuiz engine or demo directory). But this can easily
be fixed. The movie maker just needs to select the imported jobs and
apply one of her own templates to them, and by doing so, fix all
incorrect paths.</P>
