<H1>VirtualDub plug-in</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P><B><U>Important:</U> Make sure that
you read this documentation carefully in order to avoid mistakes!</B></P>
<P>The prerequisite for using this
plug-in is that you already familiar with the &ldquo;manual&rdquo;
process of encoding clips with VirtualDub (<A HREF="http://www.virtualdub.org/">www.virtualdub.org</A>).
The great thing about VirtualDub is that it offers both a graphical
user interface (GUI), accessible via <B>virtualdub.exe</B>, and a
command line interface (CLI), accessible via <B>vdub.exe</B>.</P>
<H2>Step 1: create VDub configuration
files (VCF)</H2>
<P>Let's say we had a clip that we
wanted to encode not only once, but twice &ndash; into different
formats. Let's say that the first goal is to encode it to a loss-less
Huffyuv clip, and the second goal is to encode it to a quality-based
1-pass XviD clip using MP3 sound.</P>
<P>What you need to do first is to open
VirtualDub, set up the settings for one of the goals (by going into
the video compression and audio compression dialogs) and then click
on File &rarr; Save processing settings (CTRL+S). You will end up
with saving a .vcf file somewhere on your hard drive &hellip;
remember where you put it! After that, you'd set up the settings for
your second goal and save these processing settings as well, as a new
.vcf file.</P>
<H2>Step 2: Enable and set up the VDub
plug-in</H2>
<P>First we need to set up the global
settings of the plug-in. Go into the preferences dialog and enable
the plug-in.</P>
<P><img src="images/preferences_global_vdub.gif"/></P>
<P>Use the &ldquo;...&rdquo; button to
specify the path to the vdub.exe file. The setting <B>max number of
VCFs per job</B> is important, because the number you put in there
will influence how many VCF files you will be able to select in the
<B>job dialog</B> (the dialog where you create or edit a
job/template). For our example we need to set it to 2, but it doesn't
matter if you choose a higher value. Since VDub will encode <B>two</B>
files for us, we will have to tell VDub under which filenames to save
them. You can select which approach you want to use by configuring
the setting <B>output as suffix(0) or file(1)</B>. If you <B>don't</B>
check the checkbox this means that you will enter a small part of the
file name, the <B>suffix</B>, that will be put at the end of the
original file name. E.g. if your original filename was
&ldquo;C:\render\myVideoFile.avi&rdquo;, and the suffix is
&ldquo;_huffyuv&rdquo;, the resulting file would be
&ldquo;C:\render\myVideoFile_huffyuv.avi&rdquo;. However, if you
checked that checkbox, you would instead get a &ldquo;...&rdquo;
button that allows you to specify the filename for the resulting file
manually (this is handy if you wanted to save the file to another
folder for example).</P>
<P>The <B>show extra options</B> setting
will be explained at the end of this page.</P>
<P>Let's now have a look at the dialog
when editing a job</P>
<H2>Step 3: Set up the job-specific
settings</H2>
<P>Open the job dialog.</P>
<P><img src="images/edit_job_vdub.gif" />/P>
<P>Let's ignore the 2 checkboxes at the
top for a moment. What you will need to do is to specify the path to
the 2 .vcf files you created previously in VirtualDub in step 1. Then
you need to specify the suffix (or the file using the file-chooser)
so that VDub knows where to save the encoded videos.</P>
<H2>Step 4: Run the plug-in</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>If you had your job recorded
	(without using the plug-in) then the status of the job will already
	be &ldquo;<B>done&rdquo;</B> and you can right-click the job and run
	the VirtualDub plug-in</P>
	<LI><P>If the job has <B>not</B> been
	recorded yet, just click on Start processing and wait for the result</P>
</UL>
<H2>Additional information</H2>
<H3>Empty VCF paths</H3>
<P>As you know you can specify any
number in the <B>preferences dialog</B> for the setting <B>max number
of VCFs per job</B>. In case of our example that consists of 2 jobs,
if you selected 3 (or more) as max. number, and then opened the <B>job
dialog</B>, you would see 3 fields each for the <B>path to VCF file</B>
and <B>output file</B> setting. This, however, is not a problem. The
plug-in will only execute those VCF jobs for which both the path to
the VCF and the output file fields are filled with proper
information.</P>
<H3>VDub job control</H3>
<P>You still don't know what the 2
checkboxes in the <B>job dialog</B> at the top of the VDub settings
mean. What you need to know is that VirtualDub is having its own &ldquo;job
queue&rdquo;, which, however, is called <B>&ldquo;job control&rdquo;</B>.</P>
<P>The following scenarios can make
sense:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Having <B>both</B> checkboxes
	<B>enabled</B>: Each time a new NDR job is executed which has
	VirtualDub jobs, the <B>job control</B> of VirtualDub will be
	cleared. This means that if you had other, old things in there
	(possibly when working with VirtualDub outside of the NDR) that
	these will be deleted from VirtualDub's job control, before the new
	jobs are added there. Checking the second checkbox means that after
	adding one of the VirtualDub jobs from within the the NDR,
	VirtualDub will actually encode them right away (which you will
	want, at least under normal circumstances).</P>
	<LI><P>Having <B>both</B> checkboxes
	<B>disabled</B>: In this case the only thing the NDR would do would
	be to add the two jobs to the job control of VirtualDub, but
	VirtualDub won't be encoding them. They are just put into the queue.
	This means that if you were to start the the graphical user
	interface of VirtualDub after the NDR completed processing, and open
	the Job Control (F4), you'd see these jobs &ldquo;waiting&rdquo;,
	and you could render them by pressing the Start button in Virtual
	Dub.</P>
</UL>
<P>The reason why these checkboxes exist
is flexibility. I often want the NDR to record stuff over night,
because during the recording process my PC is virtually unusable.
However, encoding clips in VirtualDub is a task that, depending on
the codec, can be done in the background and allows me to use the PC
for other things. In this case I'd disable both checkboxes, have the
NDR record all clips and add them to VirtualDub's job control, and
then on the next day, I decide when and which jobs to encode into
different formats from within the VirtualDub GUI.</P>
<P>And btw, just to be clear, the <B>second</B>
checkbox means that, <B>when enabled</B>, VirtualDub would actually
start encoding <U><B>all</B></U> clips that have already been in
VirtualDub's job control and that have not been encoded yet.</P>
<H3>Extra options</H3>
<P>If you selected the <B>show extra
options</B> checkbox in the <B>preferences dialog</B>, you will
notice that, in the <B>job dialog</B>, you got 2 additional
settings/checkboxes for each VCF file. Their names are pretty much
self-explanatory. I added these checkboxes because, after a scene was
rendered, I usually have the clip encoded into a loss-less format
(e.g. Huffyuv) right away. Since it is no problem to encode further
things (e.g. compressed XviD movies) based on the Huffyuv clip
(instead of always using the original avi file), enabling both these
checkboxes for VCF 1 would mean that the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> (3<SUP>rd</SUP>,
4<SUP>th</SUP> &hellip;) VCF jobs will be based on the
huffyuv-encoded file, and I got rid of original, big video as well,
saving hard disk space.</P>
<H3>Trouble shooting</H3>
<P>In case you suspect that the
expected, encoded file(s) is somehow incorrect (or even missing),
have a look at the <B>logs</B> directory in the NDR folder. You will
see log-files with the following format:</P>
<P>VirtualDub_NameOfTheJob_vcf1.log</P>
<P>Instead of &ldquo;vcf1&rdquo; you
might also find &ldquo;vcf2&rdquo;, &ldquo;vcf3&rdquo;... it
specifies for which VCF file of that job the log file stands for.</P>
