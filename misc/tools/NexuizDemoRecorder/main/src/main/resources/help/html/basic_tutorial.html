   <H1>Basic tutorial</H1>
<P>The following images shows the main window:</P>
<img src="images/main_window.gif" />
<P>You will notice that the main window is separated into
4 areas:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The menu bar (File, Help)</P>
	<LI><P>The &quot;Templates&quot; area which has a table
	and 4 buttons on the right</P>
	<LI><P>The &quot;Jobs&quot; area which also has a table
	and 4 buttons on the right</P>
	<LI><P>The Start/stop processing buttons</P>
</UL>
<H2>Step 1</H2>
<P>Minimize this demo recorder application for a moment
and figure out which demo(s) you actually want to record. Once you
know the names of the demo files, you have to figure out the start
time and end time (when you want the recording process to start and
end). You have to be aware that the Nexuiz demo recorder needs a
value in seconds. The problem is that there are 2 different kinds of
values.
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The first one is the one you see in your HUD in
	the top right corner. This value is not useful for the Nexuiz demo
	recorder, because the time is shown in the &lt;minutes:seconds&gt;
	format. Also this value will be changed/reset to 0 in case the
	ready-restart feature was using in the game, which resets the time.</P>
	<LI><P>On the other hand there is the <B>absolute time
	value</B>. It represents the amount of time that passed on the
	server since the map was loaded. This value will always increase
	each second, and won't be reset to 0 after a ready-restart call
	either. This is the value you need for this tool. You can obtain it
	the following ways</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>1: There is a sub-folder &quot;tools&quot; in
		this package which contains a .patch file that allows you to patch
		the source-code of the Nexuiz 2.5.2 engine. What this patch does is
		to add a new variable &quot;showgametime&quot;. Once you patched
		your source-code and compiled the engine, you can set this variable
		to 1, and then in the lower right corner you will see the current
		game time. Please note that I cannot help you with patching the
		sources and compiling the engine. For Microsoft Windows users I put
		the Nexuiz binary (darkplaces.exe) into the package as well, so you
		can use this one (copy it into your Nexuiz directory)</P>
		<LI><P>2: If the demo was recorded with Nexuiz 2.5 or
		newer you can obtain the time values by opening the console and
		entering this: prvm_global client time</P>
		<LI><P>3: If the demo was recorded with a Nexuiz version
		older than 2.5, just pause the demo at the desired moment, open the
		scoreboard (by default: hold tabulator key). The scoreboard will
		show you the current time in &lt;minutes&gt;:&lt;seconds&gt;.
		Calculate the time using a calculator (time = minutes * 60 +
		seconds)</P>
	</UL>
</UL>
<P>Make sure that you know the demo file name, start and
end time, then open the Nexuiz demo recorder tool again</P>
<H2>Step 2</H2>
<P><a name="jobs_create">In the &quot;Jobs&quot; panel</a>, click on the +Create
button. A new dialog will open which asks you for all different kinds
of things:</P>
<img src="images/create_job.gif" />
<UL>
	<LI><P><b>Engine:</b> click on the ... button and specify the
	Nexuiz engine that should be used for recording</P>
	<LI><P><b>Engine parameters:</b> Only fill this out if you already know what it
	means. Examples include to execute a particular config (+exec
	someConfig.cfg), or set a special directory (-userdir option) so
	that your Engine will use a different set of configs</P>
	<LI><P><b>DPVideo directory:</b> here you have to specify the
	path where your Nexuiz usually creates new .avi or .ogv files. This
	is one of the items where you will see that it is required that you
	already have recorded demos previously. Usually the path will be
	Nexuiz/data/video (on Windows) or ~/.nexuiz/data/video</P>
	<LI><P><b>Relative demo path:</b> This is the path that is being
	used within the virtual file-system of Nexuiz in order to find your
	demo. Normally, when starting a demo by hand, you would enter
	something like &quot;playdemo demos/stormkeep_demo.dem&quot;,
	because usually demos are stored in the directory &quot;demos&quot;.
	In case you changed that (e.g. If the demo is in a sub-directory of
	the demos directory), make sure to put this into the field. But
	usually you <B>won't</B> have to change the value (demos) to
	anything else. Just leave it as it is.</P>
	<LI><P><b>Job name:</b> Here you can specify a name for this job. If
	you don't specify any name, a name will be automatically chosen, using
	the format "Job x", where <b>x</b> is a index number.</P>
	<LI><P><b>Demo file:</b> obviously you have to specify the demo
	file here</P>
	<LI><P><b>Start second</b> and <b>end second</b> are self-explanatory</P>
	<LI><P><b>Exec before capture:</b> Here you have the chance to
	enter console commands (that is, commands that you could otherwise
	also enter into the console of the game). One example could be to
	execute a config here that will make sure that the HUD is hidden. Or
	you might want to change the FPS for the rendered video by setting
	cl_capturevideo_fps to another value. If you want to put several
	commands in here you can either separate them by a new-line, or by ;
	(semi-colon)</P>
	<LI><P><b>Exec after capture:</b> works like the &quot;exec
	before capture&quot; field. Can be used for anything, e.g. Restoring
	settings that you altered in the exec before field.</P>
	<LI><P><b>Video destination:</b> Here you have to specify where
	you want the recorded video file to be moved once the recording
	process is done. Please note that you have to enter a name for the
	file, however you should not enter the extension (.avi or .ogv). You
	don't have to, because the Nexuiz demo recorder will automatically
	figure out whether the Nexuiz engine generated an avi or ogv file,
	and will keep its ending when moving the file to its destination.</P>
</UL>
<P>Once you filled out all fields, click on create. In
case you did something wrong with one of the fields, you will
hopefully get an error message immediately, which allows you to
correct the mistake. If nothing was filled out incorrectly the dialog
should close and you should now see a &quot;Job 1&quot; in the job
queue.</P>
<P>In order to edit a job, either double-click on it, or
right-click it and click on Edit</P>
<H2>Step 3</H2>
<P>Now that you have setup your first job, click on the
<B>Start processing</B> button. After a short moment you should see
Nexuiz opening. Don't be surprised if the &quot;Loading&quot; image
appears for a long time. What you don't see is that Nexuiz is
fast-forwarding your demo to the start time you specified, which can
take some time. After that, once Nexuiz started and finished
recording the stuff you wanted it to record, it should close
automatically. The demo recorder should show you a new message dialog
that it finished recording all jobs. The &quot;Status&quot; column of
your first job should now be showing &quot;done&quot;.</P>
<H2>Trouble-shooting:</H2>
<P>In case something went wrong, the status column of your job will
show &quot;error&quot; (in the jobs table). In order to find out what the problem was,
right-click on the job and click on &quot;Show error message&quot;.
The message dialog that pops up will hopefully help you to figure out
what went wrong. If it is something that you think you can fix, do so
(by editing the job settings), then right-click the job again and click on
&quot;Reset job status to waiting&quot;. This will set the status of the job to
&quot;waiting&quot; again.</P>
<H2>Job queue processing</H2>
<P>You need to be aware that once you click on the <b>Start
processing</b> button only the jobs with status &quot;waiting&quot; will be
put into a queue and will be executed one after another. All other jobs
(with status &quot;error&quot; or &quot;done&quot; will not be started.
If an error occurs while processing one of the jobs this job will set its state to
&quot;error&quot; and the next job in queue will be executed. That is, the behavior
of the Nexuiz demo recorder is to continue working even if one or more individual
jobs failed.</P>
<P>In case you already have a job list with several
jobs but you want to just record one particular job (even though all
other jobs also have the state &quot;waiting&quot;), just right-click
on the particular job and click on &quot;Start job&quot;. Note that this only
works if the Nexuiz demo recorder is currently not working on any other jobs.</P>
<H2>Further reading</H2>
<P>Congratulations, you managed your
first steps using this program. You should read the other help
chapters as well in order to be able to fully utilize the
functionality of the program.</P>
