    <H1>Preferences dialog</H1>
<P>The preferences dialog allows you to
change the behavior of the program in certain situaitons.</P>
<P><img src="images/preferences_dialog.gif" /></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><b>Overwrite final video
	destination file if it exists:</b> This checkbox allows you to determine
	whether the final destination video file (e.g.
	<B>C:\render\fragOfTheMonth.avi</B>) should be overwritten by a job
	if that file already existed from your harddrive. By default this
	option is disabled. The program will, in this case, not overwrite
	any existing files, but save the video file with a &ldquo;copyX&rdquo;
	suffix, for example <B>C:\render\fragOfTheMonth_copy1.avi</B></P>
	<LI><P><b>Disable rendering while
	fast-forwarding:</b> As the Nexuiz demo recorder creates a cutted demo
	that has slowmo-commands in it to fast-forward it to the desired
	start time, the fast-forwarding process is often slowed down due to
	the action taking place on your screen (and your graphic card
	choking with the mere speed of the demo, e.g. during a &ldquo;slowmo
	100&rdquo; period). However, there is a variable called r_render in
	the engine which can be set to 0, which will disable any render
	updates. This will speed up the fast-forwarding process massively.
	Of course, r_render is being set to 1 a few seconds before start
	time is reached.</P>
	<LI><P><b>Disable sound while
	fast-forwarding:</b> The value of the variable volume is saved and the
	set to 0 right after the demo was loaded. The reason is that it can
	be annoying to hear the in-game sounds while fast-forwarding.</P>
	<LI><P><b>Fast-forward speed (first stage
	or second stage):</b> The demo is fast-forwarded using two different
	fast-forward speeds. In the first stage, when the start time is
	still about a minute away, the &ldquo;first stage&rdquo; value is
	used. Then, until 5 seconds before the start time, the &ldquo;second
	stage&rdquo; value is used. You will only need to manipulate these
	values if you discover that the final recorded video is inaccurate
	when it comes to the time when the recording starts (e.g. when then
	video recording starts too late, reduce these 2 values for first and
	second stage a bit &ndash; you will have to experiment)</P>
	<LI><P><b>Do not delete cut demos:</b> The
	file name of the automatically created cut demo is like the original
	name of your demo, but ends with &ldquo;_autocut.dem&rdquo;.
	Normally this demo is created, being recorded from, and then deleted
	again. If you enable this option the demo file is not deleted, and
	you can inspect it with a Hex editor or whatever else you want to do
	with it (maybe send it to a friend to have him record it?)</P>
	<LI><P><b>Append this suffix to job-name when duplicating jobs:</b>
	As you now have customizable job names it would probably be a bad idea to
	give duplicated jobs the same name as the original jobs. This is why you can
	set up a suffix that will be appended to the original job name.</P>
