   <H1>Open/Save Jobs and Templates</H1>
<P>First of all, all your templates and
jobs will automatically be saved when closing the program (and
automatically loaded when starting it again). You can find these
files in the sub-directory &ldquo;settings&rdquo;of the program, the
files are called <B>templates.dat</B> and <B>jobs.dat</B>. Please
note that the job queue will also be saved each time a job finished
its execution (so that you don't lose the progress of your jobs in
case your computer crashes while processing).</P>
<P>You have the possibility to manually
save and load other job queues (this might be handy if you are
working on different projects). For this simply use the <B>File menu</B>
and click on <B>Load job queue</B> or <B>Save job queue</B>
respectively. The same applies to templates.</P>
