    <H1>Preliminary stop</H1>
<P>If you want to preliminarily stop the
recording process, the only thing you can do is to switch to the
Nexuiz Demo Recorder window and click on <B>stop processing</B>.
However, if Nexuiz is still open and processing a demo, you have to
end it manually of wait for it to end. This means that clicking on
<B>stop processing</B> button will simply remove all jobs that
haven't been started yet from the internal queue of jobs that would
normally be processed (of course they <B>won't</B> be removed from
your jobs table).</P>
