    <H1>FAQ</H1>
<P><I>Question: Is it possible to have a
job being recorded with one of the Nexuiz presets (Low, medium,
normal, high, ultra), without affecting my Nexuiz installation in
general (so that this configuration is just active during capturing
the current demo?</I></P>
<P>Yes it is. In Nexuiz there are config
files for this, which are called:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>effects-low.cfg</P>
	<LI><P>effects-med.cfg</P>
	<LI><P>effects-normal.cfg</P>
	<LI><P>effects-high.cfg</P>
	<LI><P>effects-ultra.cfg</P>
	<LI><P>effects-ultimate.cfg</P>
	<LI><P>effects-omg.cfg</P>
</UL>
<P>In order to use them, there are 2
approaches</P>
<P><B>Approach 1:</B> You should
consider to use a new directory for each new set of effect configs
you want to try out. This will simply help you to avoid loss of your
original config, or any unwanted modification to it. For example,
setup Nexuiz manually by starting it with some userdir, e.g. <B>-userdir
effectTestUltimate</B>, start Nexuiz, go into the menu and set the
effects to ultimate (e<I>xec effects-ultimate.cfg</I> in the
console). Maybe fine-tune settings as you like. Then put the <B>-userdir
effectTestUltimate</B> directive into the <B>engine parameters</B>
field of the job.</P>
<P><b>Approach 2:</b> For this approach it is
recommended that you do a backup of your config somewhere else, even
though everything should work fine and your original config should
not be modified at all after the demo was recorded.</P>
<P>Add these 4 lines to the <b>exec before
capture</b> field:</P>
<P><B>saveconfig backup.cfg</B></P>
<P><B>cvar_resettodefaults_all</B></P>
<P><B>exec effects-ultimate.cfg</B></P>
<P><B>r_restart</B></P>
<P>The first line will backup your
current config to &ldquo;backup.cfg&rdquo;. The second line resets
all variables (you can remove this if you want, but sometimes these
effect-xyz.cfg config files will not set every single variable to the
new value, but assume that some values have their default value,
which might not be the case in your config. So resetting everything
to defaults is recommended. Of course you can choose to use another
effects config than <B>effects-ultimate.cfg</B>. After executing that
effects config a restart of the renderer (<B>r_restart</B>) is
mandatory, because of some of the changes of the effects config not
being applied without a renderer-restart. Also, keep in mind that the
cvar_resettodefaults_all will have changed your Nexuiz screen
resolution (vid_height, vid_width). The r_restart command however
won't take these changes into account (it will still use your old resolution),
only <B>vid_restart</B> would.
This just means that you do not have to change these 2 variables
manually to &ldquo;keep&rdquo; your old screen resolution, as long as
you don't use vid_restart.</P>
<P>Also add this to your <b>exec after
capture</b> field:</P>
<P><B>cvar_resettodefaults_all</B></P>
<P><B>exec backup.cfg</B></P>
<P>Please note: in case you want to
setup other special things, e.g. whether to record in the AVI instead
of OGV format, the video FPS, etc, you'd have to put these settings
some place <B>after</B> the <B>cvar_resettodefaults_all</B> command
in the <B>exec before capture</B> field.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>Question: Is it possible to record
a job in a particular screen resolution?</I></P>
<P>Yes it is. The height and width are
configured by setting the value vid_height and vid_width to your
desired value. For example to record a demo in the HD resolution,
which is 1280x720, put this into the <B>exec before capture</B>
field:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>vid_width 1280</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>vid_height 720</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>vid_restart</B></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>Question: I have found a bug, or I
encountered some other problem, what do I do? </I>
</P>
<P>Well, truth to be told, I cannot
guarantee for any support of this tool. You can put questions or
comments into the forum thread of the AlienTrap forums where you
downloaded the tool from.</P>
