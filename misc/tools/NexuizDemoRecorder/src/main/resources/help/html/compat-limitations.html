   <H1>Compatibility and limitations</H1>

<H1>Compatibility</H1>
<H2>Operating system</H2>
<P>Since this tool is written in Java
you can use it on Windows, Linux and Mac OS. This means that it can
be used on all platforms supported by Nexuiz. You do need Java 6.</P>
<H2>Nexuiz engine version</H2>
<P>In order to use this tool you will
need to use a Nexuiz engine of version 2.5 or newer. The reason is
that the engine needs to have the variables
cl_capturevideo_nameformat and cl_capturevideo_number. If you use
older engines, such as the 2.3 engine, recording will work, but the
tool will be unable to move the avi clip rendered by the engine to
your desired location. However, you can manually move it and simply
ignore the fact that the job finished with an &ldquo;error&rdquo;.</P>
<H2>Demo file version</H2>
<P>There is not really any limitation
about the Nexuiz version that was used when recording the demo. That
means that you should be able to use the Nexuiz demo recorder with
demos from previous Nexuiz versions (they can be older than 2.5). You
just have to make sure that the engine binary you use for recording
them is v2.5 and newer. Keep in mind that using a newer-generation
engine such as the 2.5 one for older demos should usually work
without problems. You might have to move the dataXXXXXX.pk3 files
from the Nexuiz version that corresponds to the demo version into the
data directory.</P>
<H2>Nexuiz Demo Recorder job queues</H2>
<P>Table preferences, job queues and template lists are not compatible
between v0.1 and newer versions! Make sure you install this in a different
direcory than v0.1!</P>
<H1>Limitations</H1>
<P>This tool only works with 1-map demos
(such as the one being automatically recorded by Nexuiz when using
the cl_autodemo feature). If you manually recorded a demo that
contains several maps, you can only specify a start- and endtime for
the first map. However, you can try to use the demosplit.pl script
from svn (trunk/misc/tools/demosplit.pl) to split demos having
several maps into several 1-map demos. However, note that this tool
will probably only work properly for older demos (up to Nexuiz v2.4.2
demos).</P>
