    <H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>Welcome to the Nexuiz demo recorder. This tool is made
for people <B>who are already familiar</B> with the manual demo
recording process and are looking for a way to automate this process.
In simple words, this tool allows you to create jobs that are being
put into a job queue, so that they can be executed one after another,
at a point in time when you don't need to access your computer
anymore. For each job you have to specify the demo you want to
record, the second when the record is supposed to start and end, as
well as the location where to save the final video file to. You can
also use one or more of the available plug-ins to encode the resulting
video file to another format.</P>
