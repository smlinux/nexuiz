    <H1>How it works</H1>
<P>The following is a description of how
the program processes a single job:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The program takes your original
	demo, e.g. &ldquo;C:\Nexuiz\data\demos\test.dem&rdquo; and creates a
	copy of it, the <I>cut demo</I>. This file has the name
	&lt;original_demo_name&gt;<B>_autocut</B>.dem. The cut demo is
	different to the original demo in a way that console commands have
	been <I>injected</I>, so basically the engine thinks that you had
	entered them yourself (e.g. cl_capturevideo 1 to start recording).</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>Since it is possible to inject
		any possible console command, the first command that is injected is
		to disable rendering (r_render 0), save the value of your &ldquo;volume&rdquo;
		setting and then setting it to 0 (as long as you have sound and
		rendering disabled while fast-forwarding in the preferences of the
		Demo Recorder). Then a slowmo 100 command (first stage value from
		the Demo Recorder preferences) is injected in order to fast-forward
		the demo.</P>
		<LI><P>Then, when the game time in the
		demo is about 1 minute less than your specified start time of the
		job, slowmo is reduced to 10 (second stage value from the
		preferences)</P>
		<LI><P>Then, when the game time in the
		demo is about 5 seconds less than your specified start time, <B>slowmo</B>
		is set to <B>1</B>, rendering and sound is enabled again, and
		whatever your put into the <B>exec before capture</B> field is
		being injected, too. Then, the values of cl_capturevideo_nameformat
		and _number are being saved to a temporary variable and are
		overwritten with defined values (<B>autorec</B> and <B>1234567</B>),
		so that the Nexuiz Demo Recorder will know the exact name of the
		output file (which is necessary so that it can move that file to
		your desired video destination/location)</P>
		<LI><P>When the the start time is
		reached, cl_capturevideo 1 is injected, once the end time is
		reached, cl_capturevideo 0 is injected.</P>
		<LI><P>Shortly after, whatever you put
		into the exec after capture field is executed, and then the
		original values of cl_capturevideo_nameformat and _number are being
		restored.</P>
		<LI><P>Then a disconnect command is
		injected</P>
	</UL>
	<LI><P>Next, your specified Nexuiz
	engine binary is launched. The parameters given to the binary are:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>The content of the <B>engine
		parameters</B> field of the job, and</P>
		<LI><P><B>-demo
		&lt;relative-demo-path&gt;/&lt;demo-file-name&gt;</B> (this will
		start Nexuiz, e.g. <B>-demo demos/test.dem</B>, launch the <B>test.dem</B>
		demo, and the engine will play the complete demo until a disconnect
		is issued (which we have injected above), and then Nexuiz will
		close automatically. This -demo parameter exists since Nexuiz 1.0</P>
	</UL>
	<LI><P>Once the Nexuiz Demo Recorder
	notices that your Nexuiz engine binary closed, it will look for the
	recorded video file in &lt;DPVideo-directory&gt;/autorec1234567.&lt;avi/ogv&gt;
	and move it (rename it) to your desired &lt;video-destination&gt;,
	keeping the original extension of the file. In case the preferences
	are setup to not overwrite an existing video file, a file with
	ending _copy1 (2, 3, &hellip;) will be created.</P>
</UL>
