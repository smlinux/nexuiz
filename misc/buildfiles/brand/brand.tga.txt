How they are created:

GIMP

Script-Fu/Logos/Hot Glow
  Font: Bitstream Vera Sans Bold
  Font size: 24

After that, delete the black background layer and make the first layer
"Normal" instead of "Overlay". This makes the text black instead of
yellow-white.

After that: Image/Canvas size, disable aspect ratio protection and increase
height to 77 pixels. Do not touch width. The image shall be at the top of
the new canvas. This is done so the text won't write over the HUD.

If it were important enough, I'd edit the Script-Fu to make my own... ;)
