- Replace the next/prev with arrow graphics- Add "Player" options to the options menu. Which could show a selection screen alike to map selection, but this time load the pictures files from the "zym" files in the /models/player/ folder like you do with the bsp files. Once the picture is selected, show a larger version of the picture above the player selection table. And also, load a txt file from the same directory that shows info on the model for the user to see.- Add a "player name:" option to the player options menu.- Replace "Max Bots" with just "Bots"- Add the current game/effects options from the darkplaces menu to the nexuiz menu
