//checkextension function
//idea: expected by almost everyone
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
float(string s) checkextension = #99;
//description:
//check if (cvar("pr_checkextension")) before calling this, this is the only
//guarenteed extension to be present in the extension system, it allows you
//to check if an extension is available, by name, to check for an extension
//use code like this:
//// (it is recommended this code be placed in worldspawn or a worldspawn called function somewhere)
//if (cvar("pr_checkextension"))
//if (checkextension("DP_SV_SETCOLOR"))
//	ext_setcolor = TRUE;
//from then on you can check ext_setcolor to know if that extension is available

//DP_QC_TRACE_MOVETYPES
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: id Software
//constant definitions:
float MOVE_NORMAL = 0; // same as FALSE
float MOVE_NOMONSTERS = 1; // same as TRUE
float MOVE_MISSILE = 2; // save as movement with .movetype == MOVETYPE_FLYMISSILE
//description:
//this extension does nothing (do not check for it), it only documents existing MOVE_ values that were never defined in defs.qc, these are passed as the 'nomonsters' parameter to traceline/tracebox

//DP_QC_TRACE_MOVETYPE_WORLDONLY
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//constant definitions:
float MOVE_WORLDONLY = 3;

//client console commands:
//"loadsky" (parameters: "basename", example: "mtnsun_" would load "mtnsun_up.tga" and "mtnsun_rt.tga" and similar names, use "" to revert to quake sky, note: this is the same as Quake2 skybox naming)
//description:
//sets global skybox for the map for this client (can be stuffed to a client by QC), does not hurt much to repeatedly execute this command, please don't use this in mods if it can be avoided (only if changing skybox is REALLY needed, otherwise please use DP_GFX_SKYBOX).

//DP_EF_ADDITIVE

//entity attributes used for rendering/networking:
//idea: Nehahra
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//DP_ENT_ALPHA
//field definition:
.float alpha;
//description:
//controls opacity of the entity, 0.0 is forced to be 1.0 (otherwise everything would be invisible), use -1 if you want to make something invisible, 1.0 is solid (like normal).

/*
//NOTE: no longer supported by darkplaces because no one used it
//DP_ENT_COLORMOD // no longer supported
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//field definition:
.vector colormod;
//description:
//controls color of the entity, '0 0 0', is forced to be '1 1 1' (otherwise everything would be black), used for tinting objects, for instance using '1 0.6 0.4' on an ogre would give you an orange ogre (order is red green blue).
*/

//DP_ENT_CUSTOMCOLORMAP
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//if .colormap is set to 1024 + pants + shirt * 16, those colors will be used for colormapping the entity, rather than looking up a colormap by player number.

/*
//NOTE: no longer supported by darkplaces because all entities are delta compressed now
//DP_ENT_DELTACOMPRESS // no longer supported
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//effects bit:
float EF_DELTA = 8388608;
//description:
//(obsolete) applies delta compression to the network updates of the entity, making updates smaller, this might cause some unreliable behavior in packet loss situations, so it should only be used on numerous (nails/plasma shots/etc) or unimportant objects (gibs/shell casings/bullet holes/etc).
*/

//DP_ENT_EXTERIORMODELTOCLIENT
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//fields:

//DP_ENT_GLOW
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//field definitions:
.float glow_color;
.float glow_size;
.float glow_trail;
//description:
//customizable glowing light effect on the entity, glow_color is a paletted (8bit) color in the range 0-255 (note: 0 and 254 are white), glow_size is 0 or higher (up to the engine what limit to cap it to, darkplaces imposes a 1020 limit), if glow_trail is true it will leave a trail of particles of the same color as the light.

//DP_ENT_LOWPRECISION

//DP_ENT_SCALE
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//field definitions:

//DP_ENT_VIEWMODEL
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//field definitions:
.entity viewmodelforclient;
//description:
//this is a very special capability, attachs the entity to the view of the client specified, origin and angles become relative to the view of that client, all effects can be used (multiple skins on a weapon model etc)...  the entity is not visible to any other client.

//DP_GFX_FOG
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//worldspawn fields:
//"fog" (parameters: "density red green blue", example: "0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3")
//description:
//global fog for the map, can not be changed by QC

//DP_GFX_SKYBOX
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//worldspawn fields:
//"sky" (parameters: "basename", example: "mtnsun_" would load "mtnsun_up.tga" and "mtnsun_rt.tga" and similar names, note: "sky" is also used the same way by Quake2)
//description:
//global skybox for the map, can not be changed by QC

//DP_GFX_EXTERNALTEXTURES
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//loads external textures found in various directories (tenebrae compatible)...
/*
in all examples .tga is merely the base texture, it can be any of these:
.tga (base texture)
_glow.tga (fullbrights or other glowing overlay stuff, NOTE: this is done using additive blend, not alpha)
_pants.tga (pants overlay for colormapping on models, this should be shades of grey (it is tinted by pants color) and black wherever the base texture is not black, as this is an additive blend)
_shirt.tga (same idea as pants, but for shirt color)
_diffuse.tga (this may be used instead of base texture for per pixel lighting)
_gloss.tga (specular texture for per pixel lighting, note this can be in color (tenebrae only supports greyscale))
_norm.tga (normalmap texture for per pixel lighting)
_bump.tga (bumpmap, converted to normalmap at load time, supported only for reasons of tenebrae compatibility)
_luma.tga (same as _glow but supported only for reasons of tenebrae compatibility)

due to glquake's incomplete Targa(r) loader, this section describes
required Targa(r) features support:
types:
type 1 (uncompressed 8bit paletted with 24bit/32bit palette)
type 2 (uncompressed 24bit/32bit true color, glquake supported this)
type 3 (uncompressed 8bit greyscale)
type 9 (RLE compressed 8bit paletted with 24bit/32bit palette)
type 10 (RLE compressed 24bit/32bit true color, glquake supported this)
type 11 (RLE compressed 8bit greyscale)
attribute bit 0x20 (Origin At Top Left, top to bottom, left to right)

image formats guarenteed to be supported: tga, pcx, lmp
image formats that are optional: png, jpg

mdl/spr/spr32 examples:
skins are named _A (A being a number) and skingroups are named like _A_B
these act as suffixes on the model name...
example names for skin _2_1 of model "progs/armor.mdl":
game/override/progs/armor.mdl_2_1.tga
game/textures/progs/armor.mdl_2_1.tga
game/progs/armor.mdl_2_1.tga
example names for skin _0 of the model "progs/armor.mdl":
game/override/progs/armor.mdl_0.tga
game/textures/progs/armor.mdl_0.tga
game/progs/armor.mdl_0.tga
note that there can be more skins files (of the _0 naming) than the mdl
contains, this is only useful to save space in the .mdl file if classic quake
compatibility is not a concern.

bsp/md2/md3 examples:
example names for the texture "quake" of model "maps/start.bsp":
game/override/quake.tga
game/textures/quake.tga
game/progs/quake.tga

sbar/menu/console textures: for example the texture "conchars" (console font) in gfx.wad
game/override/gfx/conchars.tga
game/textures/gfx/conchars.tga
game/gfx/conchars.tga

//DP_GFX_QUAKE3MODELTAGS
//idea: id Software
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//field definitions:
.entity tag_entity; // entity this is attached to (call setattachment to set this)
.float tag_index; // which tag on that entity (0 is relative to the entity, > 0 is an index into the tags on the model if it has any) (call setattachment to set this)
//builtin definitions:
void(entity e, entity tagentity, string tagname) setattachment = #443; // attachs e to a tag on tagentity (note: use "" to attach to entity origin/angles instead of a tag)
//description:
//allows entities to be visually attached to model tags (which follow animations perfectly) on other entities, for example attaching a weapon to a player's hand, or upper body attached to lower body, allowing it to change angles and frame separately (note: origin and angles are relative to the tag, use '0 0 0' for both if you want it to follow exactly, this is similar to viewmodelforclient's behavior).
//note 2: if the tag is not found, it defaults to "" (attach to origin/angles of entity)
//note 3: attaching to world turns off attachment
//note 4: the entity that this is attached to must be visible for this to work

//DP_GFX_SKINFILES
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//alias models (mdl, md2, md3) can have .skin files to replace conventional texture naming, these have a naming format such as:
//progs/test.md3_0.skin
//progs/test.md3_1.skin
//...
//
//these files contain replace commands (replace meshname shadername), example:
//replace "helmet" "progs/test/helmet1.tga" // this is a mesh shader replacement
//replace "teamstripes" "progs/test/redstripes.tga"
//replace "visor" "common/nodraw" // this makes the visor mesh invisible
////it is not possible to rename tags using this format
//
//Or the Quake3 syntax (100% compatible with Quake3's .skin files):
//helmet,progs/test/helmet1.tga // this is a mesh shader replacement
//teamstripes,progs/test/redstripes.tga
//visor,common/nodraw // this makes the visor mesh invisible
//tag_camera, // this defines that the first tag in the model is called tag_camera
//tag_test, // this defines that the second tag in the model is called tag_test
//
//any names that are not replaced are automatically show up as a grey checkerboard to indicate the error status, and "common/nodraw" is a special case that is invisible.
//this feature is intended to allow multiple skin sets on md3 models (which otherwise only have one skin set).
//other commands might be added someday but it is not expected.

//DP_HALFLIFE_MAP
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc

//description:
//set to the state of the +button3, +button4, +button5, +button6, +button7, and +button8 buttons from the client, this does not involve protocol changes (the extra 6 button bits were simply not used).

//DP_MONSTERWALK
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc

//MOVETYPE_WALK is permitted on non-clients, so bots can move smoothly, run off ledges, etc, just like a real player.

//DP_MOVETYPEBOUNCEMISSILE
//idea: id Software
//darkplaces implementation: id Software
//movetype definitions:
float MOVETYPE_BOUNCEMISSILE = 11;
//description:
//MOVETYPE_BOUNCE but without gravity, and with full reflection (no speed loss like grenades have), in other words - bouncing laser bolts.

//DP_MOVETYPEFOLLOW
//idea: id Software, LordHavoc (redesigned)
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//movetype definitions:
float MOVETYPE_FOLLOW = 12;
//description:
//MOVETYPE_FOLLOW implemented, this uses existing entity fields in unusual ways:
//aiment - the entity this is attached to.
//punchangle - the original angles when the follow began.
//view_ofs - the relative origin (note that this is un-rotated by punchangle, and that is actually the only purpose of punchangle).
//v_angle - the relative angles.
//here's an example of how you would set a bullet hole sprite to follow a bmodel it was created on, even if the bmodel rotates:
//hole.movetype = MOVETYPE_FOLLOW; // make the hole follow
//hole.solid = SOLID_NOT; // MOVETYPE_FOLLOW is always non-solid
//hole.aiment = bmodel; // make the hole follow bmodel
//hole.punchangle = bmodel.angles; // the original angles of bmodel
//hole.view_ofs = hole.origin - bmodel.origin; // relative origin

//description:
//similar to traceline but much more useful, traces a box of the size specified (technical note: currently the hull size can only be one of the sizes used in the map for bmodel collisions, entity collisions will pay attention to the exact size specified however, this is a collision code limitation in quake itself, and will be fixed eventually).

//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//solid definitions:
float SOLID_CORPSE = 5;
//description:
//the entity will not collide with SOLID_CORPSE and SOLID_SLIDEBOX entities (and likewise they will not collide with it), this is useful if you want dead bodies that are shootable but do not obstruct movement by players and monsters, note that if you traceline with a SOLID_SLIDEBOX entity as the ignoreent, it will ignore SOLID_CORPSE entities, this is desirable for visibility and movement traces, but not for bullets, for the traceline to hit SOLID_CORPSE you must temporarily force the player (or whatever) to SOLID_BBOX and then restore to SOLID_SLIDEBOX after the traceline.

//field definitions:
.vector movement;
//engine-called QC prototypes:
//void() SV_PlayerPhysics;
//description:
//.movement vector contains the movement input from the player, allowing QC to do as it wishs with the input, and SV_PlayerPhysics will completely replace the player physics if present (works for all MOVETYPE's), see darkplaces mod source for example of this function (in playermovement.qc, adds HalfLife ladders support, as well as acceleration/deceleration while airborn (rather than the quake sudden-stop while airborn), and simplifies the physics a bit)

//DP_SV_SETCOLOR

//engine called QC functions (optional):
//void(float color) SV_ChangeTeam;
//description:
//setcolor sets the color on a client and updates internal color information accordingly (equivilant to stuffing a "color" command but immediate)
//SV_ChangeTeam is called by the engine whenever a "color" command is recieved, it may decide to do anything it pleases with the color passed by the client, including rejecting it (by doing nothing), or calling setcolor to apply it, preventing team changes is one use for this.
//the color format is pants + shirt * 16 (0-255 potentially)

//DP_SV_SLOWMO
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//cvars:
//"slowmo" (0+, default 1)
//description:
//sets the time scale of the server, mainly intended for use in singleplayer by the player, however potentially useful for mods, so here's an extension for it.
