//DP_QC_BOTCLIENT
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//builtin definitions:
//entity() spawnclient = #; // like spawn but for client slots (also calls relevant connect/spawn functions), returns world if no clients available
//void(entity e) removeclient = #; // like remove but for client slots (also calls relevant disconnect functions)
//description:
//functions to allow bots to use client slots with no hacks, some notes:
//.netname controls name on scoreboard (so be sure to set it)
//.frags controls score on scoreboard (this is expected)
//.clientcolors controls coloring on scoreboard (this determines player colors exactly like the "color" command, except for using )

//unassigned stuff:  (need to write up specs but haven't yet)
.vector punchvector; // DP_SV_PUNCHVECTOR
.float  ping; // DP_SV_PING

//checkextension function
//idea: expected by almost everyone
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
float(string s) checkextension = #99;
//description: check if (cvar("pr_checkextension")) before calling this, this is the only guarenteed extension to be present in the extension system, it allows you to check if an extension is available, by name, to check for an extension use code like this:
//// (it is recommended this code be placed in worldspawn or a worldspawn called function somewhere)
//if (cvar("pr_checkextension"))
//if (checkextension("DP_SV_SETCOLOR"))
//	ext_setcolor = TRUE;
//from then on you can check ext_setcolor to know if that extension is available

//client console commands:
//"loadsky" (parameters: "basename", example: "mtnsun_" would load "mtnsun_up.tga" and "mtnsun_rt.tga" and similar names, use "" to revert to quake sky, note: this is the same as Quake2 skybox naming)
//description:
//sets global skybox for the map for this client (can be stuffed to a client by QC), does not hurt much to repeatedly execute this command, please don't use this in mods if it can be avoided (only if changing skybox is REALLY needed, otherwise please use DP_GFX_SKYBOX).

//DP_ENT_ALPHA
//field definition:
.float alpha;
//description:
//controls opacity of the entity, 0.0 is forced to be 1.0 (otherwise everything would be invisible), use -1 if you want to make something invisible, 1.0 is solid (like normal).

//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//effects bit:
float EF_DELTA = 8388608;
//description:

//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//field definitions:
.entity viewmodelforclient;
//description:

//description:
//global skybox for the map, can not be changed by QC

//DP_GFX_EXTERNALTEXTURES
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//loads external textures found in various directories (tenebrae compatible)...
/*
in all examples .tga is merely the base texture, it can be any of these:
.tga (base texture)
_glow.tga (fullbrights or other glowing overlay stuff, NOTE: this is done using additive blend, not alpha)
_pants.tga (pants overlay for colormapping on models, this should be shades of grey (it is tinted by pants color) and black wherever the base texture is not black, as this is an additive blend)
_shirt.tga (same idea as pants, but for shirt color)
_diffuse.tga (this may be used instead of base texture for per pixel lighting)
_gloss.tga (specular texture for per pixel lighting, note this can be in color (tenebrae only supports greyscale))
_norm.tga (normalmap texture for per pixel lighting)
_bump.tga (bumpmap, converted to normalmap at load time, supported only for reasons of tenebrae compatibility)
_luma.tga (same as _glow but supported only for reasons of tenebrae compatibility)

due to glquake's incomplete Targa(r) loader, this section describes
required Targa(r) features support:
types:
type 1 (uncompressed 8bit paletted with 24bit/32bit palette)
type 2 (uncompressed 24bit/32bit true color, glquake supported this)
type 3 (uncompressed 8bit greyscale)
type 9 (RLE compressed 8bit paletted with 24bit/32bit palette)
type 10 (RLE compressed 24bit/32bit true color, glquake supported this)
type 11 (RLE compressed 8bit greyscale)
attribute bit 0x20 (Origin At Top Left, top to bottom, left to right)

image formats guarenteed to be supported: tga, pcx, lmp
image formats that are optional: png, jpg

mdl/spr/spr32 examples:
skins are named _A (A being a number) and skingroups are named like _A_B
these act as suffixes on the model name...
example names for skin _2_1 of model "progs/armor.mdl":
game/override/progs/armor.mdl_2_1.tga
game/textures/progs/armor.mdl_2_1.tga
game/progs/armor.mdl_2_1.tga
example names for skin _0 of the model "progs/armor.mdl":
game/override/progs/armor.mdl_0.tga
game/textures/progs/armor.mdl_0.tga
game/progs/armor.mdl_0.tga
note that there can be more skins files (of the _0 naming) than the mdl
contains, this is only useful to save space in the .mdl file if classic quake
compatibility is not a concern.

bsp/md2/md3 examples:
example names for the texture "quake" of model "maps/start.bsp":
game/override/quake.tga
game/textures/quake.tga
game/progs/quake.tga

sbar/menu/console textures: for example the texture "conchars" (console font) in gfx.wad
game/override/gfx/conchars.tga
game/textures/gfx/conchars.tga
game/gfx/conchars.tga

//DP_MOVETYPEBOUNCEMISSILE
//idea: id Software
//darkplaces implementation: id Software

//DP_MOVETYPEFOLLOW
//idea: id Software, LordHavoc (redesigned)
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//movetype definitions:
float MOVETYPE_FOLLOW = 12;

//punchangle - the original angles when the follow began.
//view_ofs - the relative origin (note that this is un-rotated by punchangle, and that is actually the only purpose of punchangle).
//v_angle - the relative angles.
//here's an example of how you would set a bullet hole sprite to follow a bmodel it was created on, even if the bmodel rotates:
//hole.movetype = MOVETYPE_FOLLOW; // make the hole follow
//hole.solid = SOLID_NOT; // MOVETYPE_FOLLOW is always non-solid
//hole.aiment = bmodel; // make the hole follow bmodel
//hole.punchangle = bmodel.angles; // the original angles of bmodel

//description:
//similar to traceline but much more useful, traces a box of the size specified (technical note: currently the hull size can only be one of the sizes used in the map for bmodel collisions, entity collisions will pay attention to the exact size specified however, this is a collision code limitation in quake itself, and will be fixed eventually).

//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//solid definitions:
float SOLID_CORPSE = 5;
//description:
//the entity will not collide with SOLID_CORPSE and SOLID_SLIDEBOX entities (and likewise they will not collide with it), this is useful if you want dead bodies that are shootable but do not obstruct movement by players and monsters, note that if you traceline with a SOLID_SLIDEBOX entity as the ignoreent, it will ignore SOLID_CORPSE entities, this is desirable for visibility and movement traces, but not for bullets, for the traceline to hit SOLID_CORPSE you must temporarily force the player (or whatever) to SOLID_BBOX and then restore to SOLID_SLIDEBOX after the traceline.

//void() SV_PlayerPhysics;
//description:
//.movement vector contains the movement input from the player, allowing QC to do as it wishs with the input, and SV_PlayerPhysics will completely replace the player physics if present (works for all MOVETYPE's), see darkplaces mod source for example of this function (in playermovement.qc, adds HalfLife ladders support, as well as acceleration/deceleration while airborn (rather than the quake sudden-stop while airborn), and simplifies the physics a bit)

//description:
//setcolor sets the color on a client and updates internal color information accordingly (equivilant to stuffing a "color" command but immediate)
//SV_ChangeTeam is called by the engine whenever a "color" command is recieved, it may decide to do anything it pleases with the color passed by the client, including rejecting it (by doing nothing), or calling setcolor to apply it, preventing team changes is one use for this.
//the color format is pants + shirt * 16 (0-255 potentially)

//DP_SV_SLOWMO
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//cvars:
//"slowmo" (0+, default 1)
//description:
