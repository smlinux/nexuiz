This is alike to the painkiller powerup, the users screen with turn mostly white, they will be able to run twice as fast, their weapon will automaticly be a railgun with radius damage equal to the rocket launcher. They have 100 health, or 15 seconds (if the 100 health is taken away the powerup is gone). This powerup can also be earned, with kills in a short amount of time. If the user gets about 8 kills in 13 seconds, this powerup is given to the user.
