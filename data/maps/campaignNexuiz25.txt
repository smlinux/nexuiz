"dm","runningman_1on1remix",1,1,10,,"DM: Running Man (1on1)","Welcome to the Nexuiz Campaign!\n\nFirst of all, you're going to learn the controls of the game by playing an easy 1on1 deathmatch against a single unskilled bot.\n\nFirst one to kill the other 10 times wins."
"dm","darkzone",2,2,15,,"DM: Q1DM6 Remake","On this remake of a beloved level from the original Quake(r) from id Software, you'll face two bots on a somewhat higher skill level.\n\n15 frags will make you a winner here."

"dm","soylent",1,4,20,,"DM: Soylent Space","This time, you will face a single bot on an interesting space arena that allows many movement tricks. Try to learn these tricks so you can find your enemy faster.\n\nYou win once you have 20 frags."
"dm","skyway",3,3,15,"g_minstagib 1","SPECIAL: Skyway","MinstaGib means that everyone is equipped with a single weapon that both kills with one shot, and can be used for jumping like the Laser can.\n\nLearn using it to fight off the three enemies that somehow have arrived here too!\n\nThe frag limit is 15."

You should know what to do now.\n\nOf course, always avoid hitting team mates, as that damage reflects back to you.\n\nThis is the final TDM match; if you win, you may be interested in joining the Nexuiz Ladder to compare your strength with the one of other players."

Here, you are supposed to take the enemy flag, and bring it back to yours.\n\nAlso, you have to prevent the enemy from doing the same, as you can only capture his flag when your flag is still at your base.\n\nLet's start out easy, with a single bot in the enemy team. 100 points win."
