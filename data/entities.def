//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED func_plat (0 .5 .8) ?
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off. There are no proper sounds for this entity, only beep noises. It will spawn in the game and work properly but it sounds silly (see Notes).
-------- KEYS --------
speed : determines how fast the plat moves (default 150).
lip : lip remaining at end of move (default 16). Has no effect if "height" is set.
height : if set, this will determine the total amount of vertical travel of the plat.
dmg : damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of plat (default 4). Plat will reverse direction when blocked.
targetname : if set, the trigger that points to this will raise the plat each time it fires. The plat raises and comes back down a second later if no player is on it.
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
_targetname : Used to attach a misc_model entity to this entity.
_lightmapscale : Floating point value scaling the resolution of lightmaps on brushes/patches in this entity (default 1.0).
_cs OR _castshadows : Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.
_rs OR _receiveshadows : Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. < 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.
_celshader : Sets the cel shader used for this geometry. Note: omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------
_indexmap OR alphamap : Path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
_layers OR layers : Integer value is the number unique root shaders that will be use on the terrain.
_shader OR shader : Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname").*/

This can be used to create jump pads and launch ramps. The direction of push can be set by the "angles" key or pointing to a target_position or info_notnull entity. Unlike trigger_push, this is NOT client side predicted and must be activated by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
angles: this sets the pitch and yaw aiming angles of push entity (default 0 0). The roll angle does not apply.
speed : speed of push (default 1000). Has no effect if entity targets an aiming entity.
targetname : the activating trigger points to this. Push originates from the location of the trigger.
target : this points to the aiming entity to which the player will jump.

/*QUAKED target_speaker (0 .7 .7) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) LOOPED_ON LOOPED_OFF GLOBAL ACTIVATOR
Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
noise : path/name of .wav file to play (eg. sound/world/growl1.wav - see Notes).
wait : delay in seconds between each time the sound is played ("random" key must be set - see Notes).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay ("wait" key must be set - see Notes).
targetname : the activating button or trigger points to this.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOOPED_ON : sound will loop and initially start on in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
LOOPED_OFF : sound will loop and initially start off in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
GLOBAL : sound will play full volume throughout the level.
ACTIVATOR : sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).*/
