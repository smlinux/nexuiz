//DarkPlaces supported extension list, draft version 1.04

//things that don't have extensions yet:
.float disableclientprediction;

//definitions that id Software left out:
//these are passed as the 'nomonsters' parameter to traceline/tracebox (yes really this was supported in all quake engines, nomonsters is misnamed)
float MOVE_NORMAL = 0; // same as FALSE
float MOVE_NOMONSTERS = 1; // same as TRUE
float MOVE_MISSILE = 2; // save as movement with .movetype == MOVETYPE_FLYMISSILE

//checkextension function
//idea: expected by almost everyone
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
float(string s) checkextension = #99;
//description:
//check if (cvar("pr_checkextension")) before calling this, this is the only
//guaranteed extension to be present in the extension system, it allows you
//to check if an extension is available, by name, to check for an extension
//use code like this:
//// (it is recommended this code be placed in worldspawn or a worldspawn called function somewhere)
//if (cvar("pr_checkextension"))
//if (checkextension("DP_SV_SETCOLOR"))
//	ext_setcolor = TRUE;
//from then on you can check ext_setcolor to know if that extension is available

//BX_WAL_SUPPORT
//idea: id Software
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//indicates the engine supports .wal textures for filenames in the textures/ directory
//(note: DarkPlaces has supported this since 2001 or 2002, but did not advertise it as an extension, then I noticed Betwix was advertising it and added the extension accordingly)

//DP_BUTTONCHAT
//idea: Vermeulen
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//field definitions:

// LordHavoc: HIGHLY experimental, do not implement this in other engines
//DP_CGAME
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//SVC definitions:
float svc_cgame = 50; // [short] length [bytes] data
//description:
//contains network messages to client gamecode.

//DP_CL_LOADSKY
//idea: Nehahra, LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//client console commands:
//"loadsky" (parameters: "basename", example: "mtnsun_" would load "mtnsun_up.tga" and "mtnsun_rt.tga" and similar names, use "" to revert to quake sky, note: this is the same as Quake2 skybox naming)
//description:
//sets global skybox for the map for this client (can be stuffed to a client by QC), does not hurt much to repeatedly execute this command, please don't use this in mods if it can be avoided (only if changing skybox is REALLY needed, otherwise please use DP_GFX_SKYBOX).

//DP_CON_SET
//idea: id Software
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//indicates this engine supports the "set" console command which creates or sets a non-archived cvar (not saved to config.cfg on exit), it is recommended that set and seta commands be placed in default.cfg for mod-specific cvars.

//DP_CON_SETA
//idea: id Software
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//indicates this engine supports the "seta" console command which creates or sets an archived cvar (saved to config.cfg on exit), it is recommended that set and seta commands be placed in default.cfg for mod-specific cvars.

//DP_CON_ALIASPARAMETERS
//idea: many
//darkplaces implementation: Black
//description:
//indicates this engine supports aliases containing $1 through $9 parameter macros (which when called will expand to the parameters passed to the alias, for example alias test "say $2 $1", then you can type test hi there and it will execute say there hi), as well as $0 (name of the alias) and $* (all parameters $1 onward).

//DP_CON_EXPANDCVAR
//idea: many, PHP
//darkplaces implementation: Black
//description:
//indicates this engine supports console commandlines containing $cvarname which will expand to the contents of that cvar as a parameter, for instance say my fov is $fov, will say "my fov is 90", or similar.

//DP_CON_STARTMAP
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//adds two engine-called aliases named startmap_sp and startmap_dm which are called when the engine tries to start a singleplayer game from the menu (startmap_sp) or the -listen or -dedicated options are used or the engine is a dedicated server (uses startmap_dm), these allow a mod or game to specify their own map instead of start, and also distinguish between singleplayer and -listen/-dedicated, also these need not be a simple "map start" command, they can do other things if desired, startmap_sp and startmap_dm both default to "map start".

//other entities - no effect
//uses:
//disabling gun bobbing on a diving mask or other model used as a .viewmodel.
//disabling gun bobbing on view-relative models meant to be part of the heads up display.  (note: if fov is changed these entities may be off-screen, or too near the center of the screen, so use fov 90 in this case)

//description:
//controls color of the entity, '0 0 0', is forced to be '1 1 1' (otherwise everything would be black), used for tinting objects, for instance using '1 0.6 0.4' on an ogre would give you an orange ogre (order is red green blue), note the colors can go up to '8 8 8' (8x as bright as normal).

//DP_ENT_CUSTOMCOLORMAP
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//if .colormap is set to 1024 + pants + shirt * 16, those colors will be used for colormapping the entity, rather than looking up a colormap by player number.

//DP_GFX_EXTERNALTEXTURES
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//loads external textures found in various directories (tenebrae compatible)...
/*
in all examples .tga is merely the base texture, it can be any of these:
.tga (base texture)
_glow.tga (fullbrights or other glowing overlay stuff, NOTE: this is done using additive blend, not alpha)
_pants.tga (pants overlay for colormapping on models, this should be shades of grey (it is tinted by pants color) and black wherever the base texture is not black, as this is an additive blend)
_shirt.tga (same idea as pants, but for shirt color)
_diffuse.tga (this may be used instead of base texture for per pixel lighting)
_gloss.tga (specular texture for per pixel lighting, note this can be in color (tenebrae only supports greyscale))
_norm.tga (normalmap texture for per pixel lighting)
_bump.tga (bumpmap, converted to normalmap at load time, supported only for reasons of tenebrae compatibility)
_luma.tga (same as _glow but supported only for reasons of tenebrae compatibility)

due to glquake's incomplete Targa(r) loader, this section describes
required Targa(r) features support:
types:
type 1 (uncompressed 8bit paletted with 24bit/32bit palette)
type 2 (uncompressed 24bit/32bit true color, glquake supported this)
type 3 (uncompressed 8bit greyscale)
type 9 (RLE compressed 8bit paletted with 24bit/32bit palette)
type 10 (RLE compressed 24bit/32bit true color, glquake supported this)
type 11 (RLE compressed 8bit greyscale)
attribute bit 0x20 (Origin At Top Left, top to bottom, left to right)

image formats guaranteed to be supported: tga, pcx, lmp
image formats that are optional: png, jpg

mdl/spr/spr32 examples:
skins are named _A (A being a number) and skingroups are named like _A_B
these act as suffixes on the model name...
example names for skin _2_1 of model "progs/armor.mdl":
game/override/progs/armor.mdl_2_1.tga
game/textures/progs/armor.mdl_2_1.tga
game/progs/armor.mdl_2_1.tga
example names for skin _0 of the model "progs/armor.mdl":
game/override/progs/armor.mdl_0.tga
game/textures/progs/armor.mdl_0.tga
game/progs/armor.mdl_0.tga
note that there can be more skins files (of the _0 naming) than the mdl
contains, this is only useful to save space in the .mdl file if classic quake
compatibility is not a concern.

bsp/md2/md3 examples:
example names for the texture "quake" of model "maps/start.bsp":
game/override/quake.tga
game/textures/quake.tga
game/quake.tga

sbar/menu/console textures: for example the texture "conchars" (console font) in gfx.wad

//DP_GFX_EXTERNALTEXTURES_PERMAPTEXTURES
//idea: Fuh?
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//Q1BSP and HLBSP map loading loads external textures found in textures/<mapname>/ as well as textures/.
//Where mapname is the bsp filename minus the extension (typically .bsp) and minus maps/ if it is in maps/ (any other path is not removed)
//example:
//maps/e1m1.bsp uses textures in the directory textures/e1m1/ and falls back to textures/
//maps/b_batt0.bsp uses textures in the directory textures/b_batt0.bsp and falls back to textures/
//as a more extreme example:
//progs/something/blah.bsp uses textures in the directory textures/progs/something/blah/ and falls back to textures/

//DP_GFX_FOG

.float tag_index; // which tag on that entity (0 is relative to the entity, > 0 is an index into the tags on the model if it has any) (call setattachment to set this)
//builtin definitions:
void(entity e, entity tagentity, string tagname) setattachment = #443; // attachs e to a tag on tagentity (note: use "" to attach to entity origin/angles instead of a tag)
//description:
//allows entities to be visually attached to model tags (which follow animations perfectly) on other entities, for example attaching a weapon to a player's hand, or upper body attached to lower body, allowing it to change angles and frame separately (note: origin and angles are relative to the tag, use '0 0 0' for both if you want it to follow exactly, this is similar to viewmodelforclient's behavior).
//note 2: if the tag is not found, it defaults to "" (attach to origin/angles of entity)
//note 3: attaching to world turns off attachment
//note 4: the entity that this is attached to must be visible for this to work
//note 5: if an entity is attached to the player entity it will not be drawn in first person.

//DP_GFX_SKINFILES
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//alias models (mdl, md2, md3) can have .skin files to replace conventional texture naming, these have a naming format such as:
//progs/test.md3_0.skin
//progs/test.md3_1.skin
//...
//
//these files contain replace commands (replace meshname shadername), example:
//replace "helmet" "progs/test/helmet1.tga" // this is a mesh shader replacement
//replace "teamstripes" "progs/test/redstripes.tga"
//replace "visor" "common/nodraw" // this makes the visor mesh invisible
////it is not possible to rename tags using this format
//
//Or the Quake3 syntax (100% compatible with Quake3's .skin files):
//helmet,progs/test/helmet1.tga // this is a mesh shader replacement
//teamstripes,progs/test/redstripes.tga
//visor,common/nodraw // this makes the visor mesh invisible
//tag_camera, // this defines that the first tag in the model is called tag_camera
//tag_test, // this defines that the second tag in the model is called tag_test
//
//any names that are not replaced are automatically show up as a grey checkerboard to indicate the error status, and "common/nodraw" is a special case that is invisible.
//this feature is intended to allow multiple skin sets on md3 models (which otherwise only have one skin set).
//other commands might be added someday but it is not expected.

//DP_GFX_SKYBOX
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//worldspawn fields:

//DP_LITSUPPORT
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//indicates this engine loads .lit files for any quake1 format .bsp files it loads to enhance maps with colored lighting.
//implementation description: these files begin with the header QLIT followed by version number 1 (as little endian 32bit), the rest of the file is a replacement lightmaps lump, except being 3x as large as the lightmaps lump of the map it matches up with (and yes the between-lightmap padding is expanded 3x to keep this consistent), so the lightmap offset in each surface is simply multiplied by 3 during loading to properly index the lit data, and the lit file is loaded instead of the lightmap lump, other renderer changes are needed to display these of course...  see the litsupport.zip sample code (almost a tutorial) at http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces for more information.

//hole.movetype = MOVETYPE_FOLLOW; // make the hole follow
//hole.solid = SOLID_NOT; // MOVETYPE_FOLLOW is always non-solid
//hole.aiment = bmodel; // make the hole follow bmodel

//example: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"   (result looks like: 2007-02-08 01:03:15)
//note: "%F %T" gives the same result as "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" (ISO 8601 date format and 24-hour time)
//for more format codes please do a web search for strftime 3 and you should find the man(3) pages for this standard C function.
//
//practical uses:
//changing day/night cycle (shops closing, monsters going on the prowl) in an RPG, for this you probably want to use s = strftime(TRUE, "%H");hour = stof(s);
//printing current date/time for competitive multiplayer games, such as the beginning/end of each round in real world time.
//activating eastereggs in singleplayer games on certain dates.
//
//note: some codes such as %x and %X use your locale settings and thus may not make sense to international users, it is not advisable to use these as the server and clients may be in different countries.
//note: if you display local time to a player, it would be a good idea to note whether it is local time using a string like "%F %T (local)", and otherwise use "%F %T (UTC)".
//note: be aware that if the game is saved and reloaded a week later the date and time will be different, so if activating eastereggs in a singleplayer game or something you may want to only check when a level is loaded and then keep the same easteregg state throughout the level so that the easteregg does not deactivate when reloading from a savegame (also be aware that precaches should not depend on such date/time code because reloading a savegame often scrambles the precaches if so!).
//note: this function can return a NULL string (you can check for it with if (!s)) if the localtime/gmtime functions returned NULL in the engine code, such as if those functions don't work on this platform (consoles perhaps?), so be aware that this may return nothing.

//DP_QC_UNLIMITEDTEMPSTRINGS
//idea: div0
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//this extension alters Quake behavior such that instead of reusing a single
//tempstring (or multiple) there are an unlimited number of tempstrings, which
//are removed only when a QC function invoked by the engine returns,
//eliminating almost all imaginable concerns with string handling in QuakeC.
//
//in short:
//you can now use and abuse tempstrings as much as you like, you still have to
//use strzone (FRIK_FILE) for permanent storage however.
//
//
//
//implementation notes for other engine coders:
//these tempstrings are expected to be stored in a contiguous buffer in memory
//which may be fixed size or controlled by a cvar, or automatically grown on
//demand (in the case of DarkPlaces).
//
//this concept is similar to quake's Zone system, however these are all freed
//when the QC interpreter returns.

*/
//see also DP_SV_CLIENTCOLORS DP_SV_CLIENTNAME DP_SV_DROPCLIENT
//How it works:
//creates a new client, calls SetNewParms and stores the parms, and returns the client.
//this intentionally does not call SV_SendServerinfo to allow the QuakeC a chance to set the netname and clientcolors fields before actually spawning the bot by calling ClientConnect and PutClientInServer manually
//on level change ClientConnect and PutClientInServer are called by the engine to spawn in the bot (this is why clienttype() exists to tell you on the next level what type of client this is).

//DP_SV_CUSTOMIZEENTITYFORCLIENT
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: [515] and LordHavoc
//field definitions:
.float() customizeentityforclient; // self = this entity, other = client entity
//description:
//allows qc to modify an entity before it is sent to each client, the function returns TRUE if it should send, FALSE if it should not, and is fully capable of editing the entity's fields, this allows cloaked players to appear less transparent to their teammates, navigation markers to only show to their team, etc
//tips on writing customize functions:
//it is a good idea to return FALSE early in the function if possible to reduce cpu usage, because this function may be called many thousands of times per frame if there are many customized entities on a 64+ player server.
//you are free to change anything in self, but please do not change any other entities (the results may be very inconsistent).
//example ideas for use of this extension:
//making icons over teammates' heads which are only visible to teammates.  for exasmple: float() playericon_customizeentityforclient = {return self.owner.team == other.team;};
//making cloaked players more visible to their teammates than their enemies.  for example: float() player_customizeentityforclient = {if (self.items & IT_CLOAKING) {if (self.team == other.team) self.alpha = 0.6;else self.alpha = 0.1;} return TRUE;};
//making explosion models that face the viewer (does not work well with chase_active).  for example: float() explosion_customizeentityforclient = {self.angles = vectoangles(other.origin + other.view_ofs - self.origin);self.angles_x = 0 - self.angles_x;};
//implementation notes:
//entity customization is done before per-client culling (visibility for instance) because the entity may be doing setorigin to display itself in different locations on different clients, may be altering its .modelindex, .effects and other fields important to culling, so customized entities increase cpu usage (non-customized entities can use all the early culling they want however, as they are not changing on a per client basis).

//This field function, when provided, is triggered on a MOVETYPE_STEP entity when it experiences  "land event".
// The standard engine behavior for this event is to play the sv_sound_land CVar sound.
//The parameter provides the velocity of the entity at the time of the impact.  The z value may therefore be used to calculate how "hard" the entity struck the surface.

//description:
//this extension allows model flags to be specified on entities so you can add a rocket trail and glow to any entity, etc.
//setting any of these will override the flags the model already has, to disable the model's flags without supplying any of your own you must use EF_NOMODELFLAGS.
//
//silly example modification #1 to W_FireRocket in weapons.qc:
//missile.effects = EF_NOMODELFLAGS; // rocket without a glow/fire trail
//silly example modification #2 to W_FireRocket in weapons.qc:
//missile.modelflags = MF_GIB; // leave a blood trail instead of glow/fire trail
//
//note: you can not combine multiple kinds of trail, only one of them will be active, you can combine MF_ROTATE and the other MF_ flags however, and using EF_NOMODELFLAGS along with these does no harm.
//
//note to engine coders: they are internally encoded in the protocol as extra EF_ flags (shift the values left 24 bits and send them in the protocol that way), so no protocol change was required (however 32bit effects is a protocol extension itself), within the engine they are referred to as EF_ for the 24bit shifted values.

//this is a port of particle effect features from clientside QC (EXT_CSQC) to server QC, as these effects are potentially useful to all games even if they do not make use of EXT_CSQC.
//warning: server must have same order of effects in effectinfo.txt as client does or the numbers would not match up, except for standard quake effects which are always the same numbers.

//DP_SV_PUNCHVECTOR
//idea: LordHavoc
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//field definitions:
.vector punchvector;
//description:
//offsets client view in worldspace, similar to view_ofs but all 3 components are used and are sent with at least 8 bits of fraction, this allows the view to be kicked around by damage or hard landings or whatever else, note that unlike punchangle this is not faded over time, it is up to the mod to fade it (see also DP_SV_PLAYERPHYSICS).

//field definitions:
.vector movement;
//cvar definitions:
//"sv_playerphysicsqc" (0/1, default 1, allows user to disable qc player physics)
//engine-called QC prototypes:
//void() SV_PlayerPhysics;
//description:
//.movement vector contains the movement input from the player, allowing QC to do as it wishs with the input, and SV_PlayerPhysics will completely replace the player physics if present (works for all MOVETYPE's), see darkplaces mod source for example of this function (in playermovement.qc, adds HalfLife ladders support, as well as acceleration/deceleration while airborn (rather than the quake sudden-stop while airborn), and simplifies the physics a bit)

//DP_SV_PRECACHEANYTIME
//idea: id Software (Quake2)
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//this extension allows precache_model and precache_sound (and any variants) to be used during the game (with automatic messages to clients to precache the new model/sound indices), also setmodel/sound/ambientsound can be called without precaching first (they will cause an automatic precache).

//DP_SV_ROTATINGBMODEL
//idea: id Software
//darkplaces implementation: LordHavoc
//description:
//this extension merely indicates that MOVETYPE_PUSH supports avelocity, allowing rotating brush models to be created, they rotate around their origin (needs rotation supporting qbsp/light utilities because id ones expected bmodel entity origins to be '0 0 0', recommend setting "origin" key in the entity fields in the map before compiling, there may be other methods depending on your qbsp, most are more complicated however).
//tip: level designers can create a func_wall with an origin, and avelocity (for example "avelocity" "0 90 0"), and "nextthink" "99999999" to make a rotating bmodel without any qc modifications, such entities will be solid in stock quake but will not rotate)

//SV_ChangeTeam is called by the engine whenever a "color" command is recieved, it may decide to do anything it pleases with the color passed by the client, including rejecting it (by doing nothing), or calling setcolor to apply it, preventing team changes is one use for this.

//range is 0 to infinite, recommended values to try are 0.1 (very slow, 10% speed), 1 (normal speed), 5 (500% speed).

//DP_SV_WRITEUNTERMINATEDSTRING
//idea: FrikaC
//darkplaces implementation: Sajt
//builtin definitions:
void(float to, string s) WriteUnterminatedString = #456;
//description:
//like WriteString, but does not write a terminating 0 after the string. This means you can include things like a player's netname in the middle of a string sent over the network. Just be sure to end it up with either a call to WriteString (which includes the trailing 0) or WriteByte(0) to terminate it yourself.
//A historical note: this extension was suggested by FrikaC years ago, more recently Shadowalker has been badmouthing LordHavoc and Spike for stealing 'his' extension writestring2 which does exactly the same thing but uses a different builtin number and name and extension string, this argument hinges on the idea that it was his idea in the first place, which is incorrect as FrikaC first suggested it and used a rough equivilant of it in his FrikBot mod years ago involving WriteByte calls on each character.

//strreplace replaces all occurrences of 'search' with 'replace' in the string 'subject', and returns the result as a tempstring.
//strireplace does the same but uses case-insensitive matching of the 'search' term

//DP_QC_CRC16
//idea: div0
//darkplaces implementation: div0
//Some hash function to build hash tables with. This has to be be the CRC-16-CCITT that is also required for the QuakeWorld download protocol.
//When caseinsensitive is set, the CRC is calculated of the lower cased string.

//DP_SV_SPAWNFUNC_PREFIX
//idea: div0
//darkplaces implementation: div0
//Make functions whose name start with spawnfunc_ take precedence as spawn function for loading entities.
//Useful if you have a field ammo_shells (required in any Quake mod) but want to support spawn functions called ammo_shells (like in Q3A).
//Optionally, you can declare a global "float require_spawnfunc_prefix;" which will require ANY spawn function to start with that prefix.
