* Uses a entity calld swampslug to handle players in the swamp
* It works like this: When the plyer enters teh swamp the spawnfunc_trigger_swamp
* attaches a new "swampslug" to the player. As long as the plyer is inside
* the swamp the swamp gives the slug new health. But the slug slowly kills itself
* so when the player goes outside the swamp, it dies and releases the player from the 
* swamps curses (dmg/slowdown) 
* 
* I do it this way becuz there is no "untouch" event.
*
* --NOTE-- 
* THE ACCTUAL slowdown is done in cl_physics.c on line 57-60
* --NOTE--
