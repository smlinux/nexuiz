Open issues:
- hitscan
  - make function WarpZone_TraceDirection
- radius damage
  - make warpzone entities radiusdamage-able, and do a new radius damage on the
    opposite side
- fast projectiles
  - when projectile touches, check if it had hit a warpzone... if it did, do
    NOT detonate, but transform
- grep for TODO and FIXME
