// bump when clients become incompatible or any other perfectly good reason
// (e.g. game data incompatibility, engine version incompatibility, etc
// note: this automatically filters the server browser, clients of the new
// version won't see old servers, and clients of the old version won't see new
// servers either

//   version a.b.c   = a0b0c
//   gameversion_min = a0(b-1)00 // show servers of the previous "line"
//   gameversion_max = a0(b+1)99 // show servers of the next "line"
// example: 2.6.3
//   gameversion 20603
//   gameversion_min 20500
//   gameversion_max 20799
// however, in 2.5.x, we will:
//   gameversion = 20000 // let other 2.5 clients connect
//   gameversion_min = 20000 // 2.5.x still has this, we cannot block it within 2.5
