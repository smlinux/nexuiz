Update .ent file and put entity info in readme too
Also describe how to print colored text etc

Populate maps with CTF flags and dom control points
*a dom map with 4 teams but only 2 points, to cause constant fighting
*nexdm17 has 4 teams and many, many dom points, so players are better off to keep moving than try to guard just one point
*nexdm12 and 13
*nexdm06

Fix Maplist filter (map type: dom, ctf, rune, etc)



Low-Priority:

Change Yellow/Green to more distinguishable colors

Rune Match:
Fix not allowing matching rune/curse pairs (slow + speed etc).  It doesn't seem to ban them properly...
Icons/text on side of screen to show what runes are carried by who
Runes begin to fade out just before they shift positions (so player can see he's about to miss it)
Runes need larger size so they can be touched more easily

Is there a way to get teams into scoreboard?
Perhaps trick the scoreboard into thinking the team entity is a player, and add 1000 to its frags so it appears above all players?

Domination, Don't lose frags
Don't lose frags in domination from self deaths (but still from killing teammates)

Balance Team points (domination)
The points you receive are equal to the # of points you control times the number of enemy players (or some related system, like regular point rate * (# of enemy players / # of ally players) so that points increase at a more controllable rate), so that a larger team has to control more points just to compete with a smaller team.

Shuffling domination points
Domination points change position occasionally to keep players moving (Supa)

Freeze Tag

Last man standing

Spectator mode
1) if the player is in freelook (and the server allows freelook), then just let the player fly around the level in either fly or noclip mode (move in the direction he looks in, even up/down, which is easy to do).
2) if the player is in 1st person follow, attach him to his target and let him watch from that player's eyes.
3) if the player is in 3rd person follow, attach him to his target and let him rotate around freely. If he looks left/right, spin around the target. If he moves forward or backward, zoom in/out.
