This is a small todo list, which doesn't have all the needed things but whatever.
You can add whatever you want to this black, and I'll try to do as many of these items as I can also.


BUGS:
- The user has to exit from every single menu he has seen, he should just have to click "esc" twice, once to get out of every menu and get back to what it started like (with the nexuiz logo in the center), and another to exit the menu entirly (if ingame).

SP MENU:
- No need to center the map that is currently selected. Just highlight it, that is all.
- Next and prev buttons should be replaced with arrows
- This is just an idea, but since we have so much extra room on the SP menu maybe we should show a large version of the map image selected? We could have 5 pictures to choose from (and then use the prev and next button to go through all the maps, exactly like it is now), and whatever map is selected could have its image enlarged in the top of the screen above all the other options (I mean a big image seperate from the 5 images)

MP MENU:


Options:



- The server selection in the 'join game' menu should still be inside the nexuiz menu
done Replace the next/prev with arrow graphics
- Make it so when the user selects a map from the map selection, a enlarged picture of that map is shown in the center of the screen (use the same picture you used for the table), and info (read from a txt file, alike to reading the picture) is then shown under the map picture. Do this for the multiplayer menu also.
- Add "Player" options to the options menu. Which could show a selection screen alike to map selection, but this time load the pictures files from the "zym" files in the /models/player/ folder like you do with the bsp files. Once the picture is selected, show a larger version of the picture above the player selection table. And also, load a txt file from the same directory that shows info on the model for the user to see.
- Add a "player name:" option to the player options menu.
- Replace "Max Bots" with just "Bots"
- Add the current game/effects options from the darkplaces menu to the nexuiz menu
done Fix bug when resizing
