* Troubleshooting

** How do I install Nexuiz?
Just unzip the |nexuiz15.zip| file. You can do this with any archive program (like [7zip (http://7zip.org)]). It's very important to remain the directory structure while unpacking (in WinZip this option is called "Use folder names"). The directory structure should look like this afterwards:
^<<
Nexuiz
|-- data
|   |-- data*.pk3
|-- *.exe
|-- *.dll
`-- nexuiz-linux-*
^>>

** When I start Nexuiz all I see is a black screen with some checkered squares
This happens when the engine can't load the data*.pk3 file. The reasons could be:
	1. you unpacked the zip file without folder names (see [How do I install Nexuiz?])
	2. on Linux: the current directory is not your Nexuiz/ folder (see [How can I place a shortcut to Nexuiz on my Linux desktop?])
	3. your download might be corrupted

** The sound is broken, it crackles and stutters
Try run |nexuiz-sdl.exe| (on Windows) or |nexuiz-linux-686-sdl| (on Linux). This version usually performs better on newer sound cards than |nexuiz.exe|/|nexuiz-linux-686-glx|.

** When I join a server or after a map change I see nothing but a black screen, but I can still move and shoot
This is probably because you don't have the map, that's running on the server. There is no map/content download in Nexuiz at the moment so you have to get the map the old fashioned way. Most servers will have a download URL in their name or welcome message. There is also a [wiki page (http://savage747.sa.funpic.de/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.CustomMaps)] dedicated to new maps.



* Server setup

** How do I start a server?
There's a tutorial on how to setup up an dedicated server in this [forum post (http://www.nexuiz.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1236)].

** Which ports do I have to open in firewall/forward from my router to run a server?
The default port is 26000 UDP. You can change that by starting Nexuiz with |nexuiz-sdl.exe -port <port>| (on Windows) or |nexuiz-linux-686-sdl -port <port>| (on Linux).
To add the command line argument on Windows, create a new shortcut to |nexuiz-sdl.exe| and right click on it. Select properties and |-port <port>| in the "Target:" line. Be sure that the "Start in:" line contains the full path to your Nexuiz folder and clock "OK".

** Is there some kind of rcon?
Yes, but it is not compatible with Quake rcon (so you can't use quake rcon tools). To enable it enter |set sv__clientcommands 1| on your server console. Don't forget to set a password with |set sv__clientcommands__password hackme|. Now you can become admin ingame by entering |ccl hackme| on the client console. To issue commands enter |cc <command>| (e.g. |cc restart| or |cc chmap dm_nexdm12|).

** How can i kick people who are using special characters in their names?
Enter |status| at the console. You will see a list of all players. In front of their names you will see a number (the player id). You can kick the player you don't like with |kick # <player id> <reason>| (notice the space after #).


* General questions

** How do I install new maps?
Maps usually ship as *.pk3 file. All you have to do is to copy this file to your |Nexuiz/data/| directory.

** How can I place a shortcut to Nexuiz on my Linux desktop?
Before you can create a desktop/menu item you have to create a little shell script. Open a text editor (like gedit or kate) and paste the following lines:
^<<
#!/bin/sh
cd `dirname $0`
./nexuiz-linux-686-sdl "$@"	# or ./nexuiz-linux-x86_64-sdl if you're using an AMD64/EM64T distributions
^>>
Save this in your Nexuiz directory as |nexuiz.sh|. Now you have to make this file executable by opening a xterm/konsole and typing:
^<<
cd /path/to/Nexuiz
chmod a+x nexuiz.sh
^>>
Finally you can add the |nexuiz.sh| file to your desktop like any other program.

** How do I open the console?
Press |\[shift]+\[escape]|. To close it press |\[escape]|

** What console commands/variables are there?
You can get a list of variables by entering |cvarlist| on the console. |cmdlist| will give you a list of available commands. An annotated version of that output can be found at the [Nexuiz wiki (http://savage747.sa.funpic.de/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.ConsoleCommands)].

** How can I speed up my frame rate?
The greatest performance boost can be achieved by turning off dynamic lights and shadows. Bloom is also quite resource intensive. On older graphics cards or on-board/notebook chips with little video ram you can try to lower the texture resolution. To do this open the console and type |gl__picmip #; r__restart| (where # is a number between 0 and 10, 0 is the highest quality).

** How can I activate colors in my name?
Colors can be used in nicknames and chat messages by typing ^ followed by a number between 0 and 9.

	! code   ! color             !

	!----------------------------!

** How do i watch/record demos?
To record a demo: open the console and type |rec <name>|. The demo file will be stored in |~/.nexuiz/data/demos/<name>.dem| (Linux) or |Nexuiz/data/demos/<name>.dem| (Windows).
To watch a demo: open the console and type |ply <name>| (|name| is the filename without extension). If you downloaded a demo, copy it to |Nexuiz/data/demos| first.
You can list all your demo files by typing |dem| on the console. Some usefull keybindings for viewing demos are listed [here (http://www.nexuiz.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1766&st=0&p=13400&#entry13400)].


* Development

** How do i set up gtkradiant to create/edit Nexuiz maps?
There's a [detailed guide (http://www.nexuiz.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=195)] on gtkradiant setup in the forums. There are also a [Linux shell script (http://www.nexuiz.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=195&view=findpost&p=11176)] and a [Windows application (http://www.nexuiz.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=195&view=findpost&p=11838)] that will configure your gtkradiant (1.4) automagically.

** Where can i get latest development versions of the source code?
_Engine:_ instructions are available at http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/download.html (you will need a [cvs client (http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/)], beta builds are available [here (http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/files/)])

_Game data:_ to check out the Nexuiz svn, you'll need a [svn client (http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html)]. To check out the repository with a commandline svn client, do
^<<
svn co svn://svn.icculus.org/nexuiz/trunk/
^>>
To compile the gamecode you need [fteqcc (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group\_id=116842&package\_id=129507)]. Just download it and run it twice, once in |data/menuqc| and once in |data/qcsrc/server|.
