   :logversion:3
   :gamestart:<gametype>_<mapname>:<matchid>
   :gameinfo:mutators:LIST:mutator1:mutator2:...

      (note that mutators are listed by their cvar name with g_ removed,
      unless such a cvar is 1 by default - then the mutator is listed with
      a no_ prefix if the cvar is 0)

   Note that only the :join and :player lines ever contain player names. The
   :time event only appears in the log files if sv_eventlog_files_timestamps
   is 1; there is no way to log these time stamps to the console (for console
   timestamps, set timestamps to 1).

team colors:
    1 = No Team (Domination)
    5 = Red Team
   14 = Blue Team
   13 = Yellow Team
   10 = Pink Team

join types:
    1 = connect
    2 = auto
    3 = manual
    4 = spectating
    6 = adminmove

label flags:
   !! = primary sorting key
   <!! = primary sorting key, lower is better
   ! = secondary sorting key
   <! = secondary sorting key, lower is better
   < = lower is better

itemstring:
   <weaponid><flags>
   or
   <weaponid><flags>|<runes>

   where flags can contain:
         F = player carries the flag
         S = player has strength
         I = player has the shield
         T = player is typing (console, menu or chat)
   
   and weapon IDs are:
         1 = Laser
		 2 = Shotgun
		 3 = Uzi
         4 = Mortar
         5 = Electro
         6 = Crylink
         7 = Nex
         8 = Hagar

        12 = Grappling Hook
        13 = Heavy Laser Assault Cannon
        14 = T.A.G. Seeker

   runes/curses are stored as a bit mask with the following values:
         1 = Strength
         2 = Defense
         4 = Regeneration
         8 = Speed
        16 = Vampire
      8192 = Weakness
     16384 = Vulnerability
     32768 = Venom
     65536 = Slow
    131072 = Empathy

death type:
   either a weapon ID ORed with weapon death flags, or one of:
     10000 = fallen to death
     10001 = telefragged
     10002 = drowned
     10003 = killed by a trap / fallen into the void
     10004 = lava
     10005 = slime
     10006 = console kill
     10007 = (MinstaGib) out of ammo
     10008 = swamp
     10009 = team change
     10010 = auto team change
     10011 = camping protection
	 10012 = player became too fast (should never happen)
	 10013 = health rot
	 10014 = mirror damage
	 10015 = g_touchexplode
	 10100 = turret
	10150 = spiderbot miniguns
	10151 = spiderbot rocket
	10152 = spiderbot, cushed by
	10300 = custom deathmessage

   weapon death flags are:
       256 = secondary fire
	   512 = splash damage
	  1024 = bounced projectile
	  2048 = head shot (MinstaNex only)
	  4096 = unused flag

There will be a log analyzer parsing this file format soon. Note that weapon
IDs are below 10000.
