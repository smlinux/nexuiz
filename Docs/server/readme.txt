In this subdirectoriy you will find scripts and a config file that can
be used to start a dedicated server on linux, mac or windows systems.
You will need to copy the right script into your Nexuiz main
directory, where the normal binaries are.  You then need to copy and
ADJUST the config file which is called server.cfg.  You can copy it
either into the Nexuiz/data directory where the big data*.pk3 file is
or when running linux or a mac you can as well copy it into a special
directory called ~/.nexuiz/data .

After you have adjusted the config file you can start the server by
executing the server script.  The options in the config file are only
the most interesting and important ones.  You can find more
information about setting up a dedicated server in the Nexuiz Wiki:
