rcon2irc - IRC gateway for Nexuiz servers, using rcon authorization


Quick installation guide:

1. Set up rcon access on your Nexuiz server, by adding some line like
     rcon_password hackme
   in your server.cfg. This password gives anyone FULL access to your server,
   so do not give it away! This IRC gateway does not work with a
   rcon_restricted_password.

2. Copy rcon2irc-example.conf to another name (e.g. rcon2irc.conf), and edit
   the settings to match your setup. At the very least:
   - change dp_server to the IP (or IP:port) of your Nexuiz server
   - change dp_password to the rcon password set above
   - change irc_server to the IRC server to connect to
   - change irc_nick to the nick name to use
   - change irc_channel to the channel to join
   
3. Run it:
     perl rcon2irc.pl rcon2irc.conf
   You may possibly want to run it in nohup so you can disconnect from your ssh
   connection, like this:
     nohup perl rcon2irc.pl rcon2irc.conf &
   Logging will then go to a file nohup.out in the same directory. Another way
   to run it permanently and to see its output is to run it inside a screen(1).


Features:

- Show results of matches in the IRC channel

- Act as a gateway to allow chat between Nexuiz server and IRC users, useful
  for making the server more interesting to the public, but also useful as a
  mere helper for the server admin to watch what's happening in game (like, if
  people complain about a problem):
  - Any line written in game using say (not say_team) goes to the IRC channel.
  - Any line written in the channel, prefixed by the bot's nick name and a :,
    goes into the Nexuiz game.
  - Example:
    View in game:
      XSAX LTU: GREAT WIN AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH))
      (RedAlert) stop teamkilling!
      .ThreeHeadedMonkey.: I am behind you!
    View on IRC, assuming the IRC gateway has the nick noobNex and is voiced:
      <+noobNex> <XSAX LTU> GREAT WIN AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH))
      <+noobNex> <.ThreeHeadedMonkey.> I am behind you!

- Notify about free slots on the server. Example:
    * noobNex is full!
    * noobNex can be joined again (2 free slots); join now: nexuiz +connect 172.23.42.54!
    <+noobNex> ctf_capturecity_v2r1 has begun (2 free slots); join now: nexuiz +connect 172.23.42.54

- Display scores at the end of a match in the IRC channel. Example:
    <+noobNex> ctf_capturecity_v2r1 ended: 301:78 Nicole 115, elsteer BLD {Y} 77,
               CensoredNickname 57, 0grueN# 29, Bigus 23, ZeroA 36, ricer 22,
               Treey@suse8 12, cZaR6RUSS7 8, BrightDev1l 0

- Authenticate to the IRC services by Nickserv or Quakenet protocol, so the
  server bot can be set up to always get voice when entering the channel, and
  in case of Nickserv, make sure nobody else prevents it from using its
  configured nick. Other authentication protocols can often be set up using
  configuration, and if not, as plugin.

- Support for /whois queries: the server hostname is put into the real name
  field for /whois, so people can see how to find the server in the server
  list.

- Plugin interface for plugins written in Perl. See included rbiserver.pl for
  an example.
